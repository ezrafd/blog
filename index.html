            <p>There. I said it. They are inelegant imitators, who leech off of human tendencies. They are not intelligent—humans are intelligent. 

                If we want to build artificial intelligence we need real understanding. Now, some would contest that LLMs do have understanding, but with all due respect Mr. Hinton, No. It’s fake it till you make it out here.

                Now this is not to say that LLMs aren’t useful, they have revolutionized the ease of most parts of my life, but they are BORING. 

                If there are opportunities to work on real intelligence, please send them my way.

            <h2>Hi.</h2>
            <h3>Monday, July 8th at 5:55 pm</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Hi. So what is this? This is a way for you to see into my mind. That is not an easy thing to do, but language is the
                best method we have so far to understand someone’s experience. I always hated writing. Unfortunately, I have come
                to realize how incredible of a tool it is. As a computer scientist, I think about our brains as computer memory and
                our writing as writing to disk. Writing to disk not only keeps it in long term storage but also sets a base of what
                makes the computer unique and provides direction if it is information of a certain type, like an app does. (If I have
                gone too far into the analogy, I am saying the app is when like we write with a purpose.) Oh, and it allows us to
                learn from people we’ve never met across countries and across generations. No wonder it changed the world.</p>
