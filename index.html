            <p>There. I said it. They are inelegant imitators, who leech off of human tendencies. They are not intelligent—humans are intelligent. 

                If we want to build artificial intelligence we need real understanding. Now, some would contest that LLMs do have understanding, but with all due respect Mr. Hinton, No. It’s fake it till you make it out here.

                Now this is not to say that LLMs aren’t useful, they have revolutionized the ease of most parts of my life, but they are BORING. 

                If there are opportunities to work on real intelligence, please send them my way.

            <h2>Hi.</h2>

            <p>Hi. So what is this? This is a way for you to see into my mind. That is not an easy thing to do, but language is the
                best method we have so far to understand someone’s experience. I always hated writing. Unfortunately, I have come
                to realize how incredible of a tool it is. It serves as an extended memory, and with the rise of AI assistants, referencing
                that memory has become many times easier. It helps us think, to collect our thoughts and create direction. It also allows us
                to communicate with others, across time and space. Not writing is like a computer trying to keep everything in memory and never
                writing to disk. No wonder it changed the world.</p>
