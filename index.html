            <p>Hi. So what is this? This is a way for you to see into my mind. That is not an easy thing to do, but language is the
                best method we have so far to understand someone’s experience. I always hated writing. Unfortunately, I have come
                to realize how incredible of a tool it is. As a computer scientist, I think about our brains as computer memory and
                our writing as writing to disk. Writing to disk not only keeps it in long term storage but also sets a base of what
                makes the computer unique and provides new direction if it is information of a certain type, like an app. (If I have
                gone too far into the analogy, I am saying the app is when like we write with a purpose.) Oh, and it allows us to
                learn from people we’ve never met across countries and across generations. No wonder it changed the world.</p>
